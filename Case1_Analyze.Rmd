# How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?
This analysis is part of the work towards the Google Certificate for Data Analytics. 
Case Study 1:
I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago.  Divvy is a Chicago's bike share system, with over 600 stations and 6,000+ bikes. The company has two types of riders, casual riders and members.

The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. 

The Data Analytics team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. 

My manager has assigned me the question: 
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

The data I will use, was provided by the company divvybikes.  https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data according to the license https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement 
Consisted of 14 files.One file per month from April 2020 to May 2021


## How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 
The answer for the question:  
Members and Casual riders use the bikes differently.  

Casual riders have fewer number of trips, with longer durations per trip.  
Members have more trips but with shorter durations per trip.  

- Trips and Duration.
- Days of the week the trips were made
- At what time were the trips made

I will show some graphics to visualize the differences

### Percentage of trips by membership
During the work week, Monday to Friday the number of trips is larger for members.  
Saturday and Sunday the decrease in the number of trips for members is expected.  

```{r Percentage_of_trips, echo = FALSE}
## Percentage trips
ggplot(divvy_data) + aes(fill = member_casual, y = hour_trip_start, x = wday_start) +
    geom_bar(position = "fill", stat = "identity") +
    labs(title = "Percentage trips per membership type",
         y = "Percentage",
         x = "Week day") +
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
          axis.text.y = element_blank(),
          axis.ticks = element_blank())

```

### Total duration of trips by membership
  
The percentage of total duratiom is larger for casual, this in spite of making fewer trips.    
  
During weekends the difference is greater indicating that members do not use the bikes as much during the weekends.    


```{r Percentage, echo = FALSE} 
ggplot(divvy_data) + aes(fill = member_casual, y = duration, x = wday_start) +
    geom_bar(position = "fill", stat = "identity") +
    labs(title = "Percentage bicycles usage per membership type",
         y = "Percentage",
         x = "Week day") +
          theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
              axis.text.y = element_blank(),
              axis.ticks = element_blank())

```

### Morning trips 7 am to 12 noon by membership
  
The number of trips is higher for members, however the diffrence diminish during the weekends.    


```{r Morning_Trips, echo = FALSE }
subset(divvy_data,hour_trip_start %in% c(7,8,9,10,11,12) )%>% 
    ggplot() + aes(x=wday_start, 
                   fill = member_casual) +
    geom_bar() +
    scale_color_brewer(palette="Blues") +
    labs(title = "Morning trips(7-12) per week day by membership type",
         y = "Number of trips",
         x = " Day of the Week") +
           theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
              axis.text.y = element_blank(),
              axis.ticks = element_blank())
        
```

### Afternoon trips 1 pm to 6 pm  by membership
  
The number of trips is higher for members, however the diffrence diminish during the weekends.    


```{r Afternoon_Trips, echo = FALSE }
subset(divvy_data,hour_trip_start %in% c(13,14,15,16,17,18) )%>% 
    ggplot() + aes(x=wday_start, 
                   fill = member_casual) +
    geom_bar() +
    scale_color_brewer(palette="Blues") +
    labs(title = "Afternoon trips(1 pm - 6 pm) per week day by membership type",
         y = "Number of trips",
         x = " Day of the Week") +
           theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
              axis.text.y = element_blank(),
              axis.ticks = element_blank())
        
```

### Winter trips  by membership

Winter season reflects the lower number of visitors compare to other seasons.  
Trips are larger for members than in other seasons.  
  

```{r Winter_Trips, echo = FALSE }
subset(divvy_data, month(started_at) %in% c(12,1,2)) %>%
